# A formatter for Workflow Description Language (WDL)

An opinionated, lossless, formatter for [WDL](https://github.com/openwdl/wdl) that ensures consistency and small diffs between projects. 

> For now there is no automated way of styling or checking the style of WDL files according to these guidelines. It is up to the authors and reviewers to ensure the guidelines are adhered to. 
> From: [*BioWDL Style Guidelines*](https://biowdl.github.io/styleGuidelines.html)


`WDLFormat` aims to solve this problem.
